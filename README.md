## Operation Manual

Turn ON Simon, and press START to begin either game.

### Game A: Simon Says

Correctly repeat a longer and longer sequence of signals.

**How to Play**

* Simon will give the first sequence of three color signals
* Repeat that signal by touching the same Color Lens. Incorrectly-entered sequences will lead to Simon repeating the current sequence.
* Simon will repeat the first sequence and add one more signal to create a new sequence.
* If you need Simon to repeat the current sequence, press the REPLAY button.
* Repeat the new sequences until you reach five rounds to win the game!

**Note:** Simon may have some difficulty remembering past sequences compared to its physical version.

### Game B: The Vault

In this Game, you control the sequence. Correctly help Simon remember what has been lost in order to see a series of signals from Simon!

**How to Play**
* Enter your desired color sequence. If the sequence is too long or invalid, the inputted sequence will reset
* If you need Simon to repeat its message, press the REPLAY button.

To reset the game, turn Simon on and off again.
